Dunicode tool
=============

What is this?
-------------

This tool is designed to highlight characters that can not be entered using a single key on the keyboard

The aim is to identify unicode characters that may not behave as expected when input to downstream systems

How does it work?
-----------------

Text entered into the left side box is assessed character by character to identify characters with a codepoint greater than 127. These characters are then highlighted in red on the right hand side

How do I make an enhancement or change?
